Notes

- We can't get user name without adding the capability to application.  It seems intrusive to require
  the user to give the application access to his/her user name.  We will allow the user to enter his/her
  name at launch and we will not leverage the network user name capabilities of Nethack.

- We do not currently support user sounds.

- SYSCF is not supported (no need to have additional administrator configuration settings)

- mouse is supported including right click support

- Environment variables can not be used in 64bit store apps.  We will
  need to allow user to specify persistent options some other way.

- keypad is supported.
