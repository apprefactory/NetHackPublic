Notes

- We can't get user name without adding the capability to application.  It seems intrusive to require
  the user to give the application access to his/her user name.  We will allow the user to enter his/her
  name at launch and we will not leverage the network user name capabilities of Nethack.
- We will not support user sounds initially
