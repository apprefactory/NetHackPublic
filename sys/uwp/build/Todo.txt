High Priority
- Review all code looking for more static locals.  This can be a problem since we can't re-initialize.
- Exit application if we hit a panic.
- Assuming we don't try to re-enter mainloop after panic, attempt to verify that most dynamic state
  has been freed.  Assuming all dynamic state is free, we should generally be able to assume all
  global pointers shoudl be NULL (assuming dynamic free routines NULL as appropriate)

Medium Priority
- Review all options and note which are supported and not supported.
- Fix clearing screen issues when recovering game file.
- Need to create seperate projects for makedefs for compiling the different options.
- Add ability to load/store/restore symbols
- Allow setting of font information.
- Polish windows store description.
- Polish GIT hub wiki pages.
- Clean up UWP file naming and placement.
- Place TextGrid positioned at top of window.
- review decl_clean_up() to see if we need to free memory before NULLing pointers

Low Priority
- see if we can remove WIN32CON definition (currently defined in vcxproj )
- persist options which are set (low priority since NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable can be used)
- add arm and arm64 support
- Add more advanced gesturing support.
- Consider supporting tiles.
- Consider providing a more advanced windowing support

Official NetHack Pull Request Work
- Update various distribution documentation to describe UWP port.
- Conform to coding standards.
- Determine if copyright notices are correct.
