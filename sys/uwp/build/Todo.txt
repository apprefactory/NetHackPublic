High Priority
- fix ability to re-enter game without exiting application (stops game passing store submission)
- add support for all platforms and configurations (x86, amd64) (release, debug)
- add tty cursor rendering

Medium Priority
- add support for bold characters (assuming they get used)
- look into what other character attributes (other then bold) should be supported

Low Priority
- persist options which are set (low priority since NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable can be used)
- add start menu before game start allowing player to edit persistent configuration settings
- consider copying data files to user data area allowing user to modify
