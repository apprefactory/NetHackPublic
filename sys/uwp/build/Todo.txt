High Priority
- Allow setting of font information.
- Review all options

Medium Priority
- Change font size as window is resized
- Review all code looking for more static locals.  This can be a problem since we can't re-initialize.
- number_pad option value is not preserved across saves -- is this documented?  Is this how it is
  supposed to be?  What options are saved with game?
- Review all options and note which are supported and not supported.
- Fix clearing screen issues when recovering game file.
- Need to create seperate projects for makedefs for compiling the different options.
- Add ability to load/store/restore symbols
- Polish windows store description.
- Polish GIT hub wiki pages.
- Clean up UWP file naming and placement.
- Place TextGrid positioned at top of window.

- add arm and arm64 support
- Add more advanced gesturing support.
- Consider supporting tiles.
- Consider providing a more advanced windowing support

Official NetHack Pull Request Work
