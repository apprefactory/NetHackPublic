High Priority
- Look into port_help().  Do we have a port help file?
- Review all code looking for more static locals.  This can be a problem since we can't re-initialize.
- Fix clearing screen issues when recovering game file.
- Allow setting of font information.
- Review all options and note which are supported and not supported.
- Verify porthelp file is the correct porthelp file in game.

Medium Priority
- Polish windows store description.
- Polish GIT hub wiki pages.
- Clean up UWP file naming and placement.
- Place TextGrid positioned at top of window.
- review decl_clean_up() to see if we need to free memory before NULLing pointers

Low Priority
- see if we can remove WIN32CON definition (currently defined in vcxproj )
- persist options which are set (low priority since NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable can be used)
- add arm and arm64 support
- Add more advanced gesturing support.
- Consider supporting tiles.
- Consider providing a more advanced windowing support

Official NetHack Pull Request Work
