High Priority
- fix ability to re-enter game without exiting application (stops game passing store submission)
- add tty cursor rendering
- need to support a way for users to specify persistent options

Medium Priority
- add support for bold characters (assuming they get used)
- look into what other character attributes (other then bold) should be supported
- rethink when we ask to hit enter on exit.  We should wait until we have implemented
  the outer shell.  This will have to come after we make changes to support starting
  main loop a second time.

Low Priority
- see if we can remove WIN32CON definition (currently defined in vcxproj )
- persist options which are set (low priority since NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable can be used)
- add start menu before game start allowing player to edit persistent configuration settings
- consider copying data files to user data area allowing user to modify
- add arm and arm64 support
