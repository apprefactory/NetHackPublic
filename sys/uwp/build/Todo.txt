High Priority
- Look into port_help().  Do we have a port help file?
- Polish windows store description.
- Polish GIT hub wiki pages.

Medium Priority
- Clean up UWP file naming and placement.
- Place TextGrid positioned at top of window.
- add support for bold characters (assuming they get used)
- look into what other character attributes (other then bold) should be supported
- rethink when we ask to hit enter on exit.  We should wait until we have implemented
  the outer shell.  This will have to come after we make changes to support starting
  main loop a second time.
- review decl_clean_up() to see if we need to free memory before NULLing pointers

Low Priority
- see if we can remove WIN32CON definition (currently defined in vcxproj )
- persist options which are set (low priority since NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable can be used)
- add start menu before game start allowing player to edit persistent configuration settings
- consider copying data files to user data area allowing user to modify
- add arm and arm64 support
- Add more advanced gesturing support.
- Consider supporting tiles.
- Consider providing a more advanced windowing support

Official NetHack Pull Request Work
- Update various distribution documentation to describe UWP port.
- Conform to coding standards.
- Determine if copyright notices are correct.
